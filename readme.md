# Mongo Scraper

### Overview

![alt text](Assets/images/index.png)

This is a mongo scraper without finished functionality

The scrape.js is borrowed, but will be switched out for a different one.

It can scrape for new articles, but you'll have to refresh the page as I didn't get that far

It uses a jquery approach with no view engine.

Mongoose is used, this project is about 70% done, but just requires jquery touches for full refresh abilities.

### Additional Information

If there are any questions, ask and I'll be willing to answer the entire functionality.

**Enjoy!**
